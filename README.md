## Train Scheduler

In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporated Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. The website also provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station [Use the Train Scheduler](https://heidijvr.github.io/Train-Scheduler/).
This project is part of the front-end curriculum for the University of Washington Part-time Coding Bootcamp.

#**Challenges:**


#**Project Requirements:**

* When adding trains, users should be able to submit the following:
  - Train Name
  - Destination 
  - First Train Time -- in military time
  - Frequency -- in minutes
  - To calculate when the next train will arrive; relative to the current time.

#**Suggested future challenges:**

* Ensure that the app is fully mobile responsive.
  * Allow users to request additional gifs to be added to the page.
  * List additional metadata such as, title and tags, for each gif.
  * Integrate this search with additional APIs such as OMDB, or Bands in Town.
  * Allow users to add their favorite gifs to a favorites section.
