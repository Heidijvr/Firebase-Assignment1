## Train Scheduler


In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporated Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. The website also provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station ([Use the Train Scheduler:smiley:](https://heidijvr.github.io/Train-Scheduler/)).
This project is part of the front-end curriculum for the University of Washington Part-time Coding Bootcamp.

**Challenges:**


**Project Requirements:**

* When adding trains, users should be able to submit the following:
  - Train Name
  - Destination 
  - First Train Time -- in military time
  - Frequency -- in minutes
  - To calculate when the next train will arrive; relative to the current time.

-----

**Suggested future challenges:**

* Updating the "minutes to arrival" and "next train time" text once every minute. 
* Adding update and remove buttons for each train. Let the user edit the row's elements -- allow them to change a train's Name,        
  Destination and Arrival Time (and then, by relation, minutes to arrival).
* Create the webpage so that only users who log into the site with their Google or GitHub accounts can use the site.
